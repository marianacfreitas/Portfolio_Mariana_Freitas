Undergraduate student in Statistics at the Federal University of Espírito Santo (UFES) (2022 - present).

Throughout my academic journey, I've developed a strong interest in statistical tools applied to healthcare. I've worked with oncological data, maternal-child health, and public health indicators, employing statistical techniques and machine learning. I've gained substantial experience with R and Shiny for exploratory analysis and creating interactive dashboards. My expertise includes survival models, machine learning adapted to censored data, and analysis of large datasets such as those from the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS). Additionally, I've participated in teaching projects, which allowed me to develop didactic skills for explaining statistical concepts clearly and objectively.

EXPERIENCES

</h3>

::: card-grid
::: card
### **Research Fellow at FAPES** (2024 - present)

Development of research in survival analysis applied to oncological data, focusing on colorectal cancer data from the Oncoentro Foundation of São Paulo (FOSP). Implemented Support Vector Machine (SVM) models adapted for censored data, evaluating prognostic factors and predictive performance.
:::

::: card
### **Fiotec Fellow** (2023 - 2025)

Development of an interactive Shiny/R dashboard with a multidisciplinary team for analyzing maternal-child health indicators in Brazil, using public SUS data. The platform enables dynamic data visualization through interactive charts and tables. The project aimed to support decision-making by healthcare managers and promote transparency in public health information dissemination.
:::

::: card
### **Fellow at Brazilian Obstetric Observatory (OOBr)** (2022 - 2023)

Worked as a fellow at OOBr, handling public data related to maternal health. My responsibilities included statistical analysis of this data, creating interactive dashboards, and information visualization using R. Additionally, I contributed to producing statistical tutorials, helping disseminate knowledge in the field.

EVENTS AND LECTURES

</h3>

::: card
### **69th RBras Annual Meeting and 21st SEAGRO Organization** (2025)

Part of the organizing commitee of 69th RBras Annual Meeting and 21st SEAGRO - one of the most important scientific events in Brazil in the fields of statistics, agriculture, and environmental sciences.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Lecturer at Daslab** (2025)

Presented a lecture on Support Vector Machines and Random Machines applied to Survival Analysis, including examples on oncological data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Lecturer at RLadies Vitória** (2024)

Served as lecturer and organizer for the "Basic R for Chemists" workshop at RLadies Vitória, a chapter of R-Ladies Global - an organization promoting gender diversity in the R community.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Poster Presentation at 66th RBras Annual Meeting** (2022)

Presented the work "Evaluation of vaccination impacts on COVID-19 data via segmented models" at the 66th RBras. The study used Poisson, quasi-Poisson, and segmented beta regression models to analyze vaccination effects on severe obstetric outcomes from COVID-19. Results highlighted the protective role of the first dose, with significant effects observed 10 to 30 days post-vaccination.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Lecturer at Data Science Workshop** (2022)

Taught the "Introduction to Shiny" course, covering the *shiny* and *shinydashboard* packages for creating interactive dashboards. The course ranged from basic Shiny app structure to building dynamic interfaces for health data visualization, with focus on obstetric data applications.
